   * Kotlin idiomatic style uses camelCase for names. However, many large language models are
   * predominantly trained on datasets where snake_case is common.
   *
   * By default, this API converts Kotlin camelCase names to snake_case to potentially improve tool
   * calling performance with models more familiar with snake_case.
   *
   * While the choice between snake_case and camelCase often has minimal impact, it can be
   * significant for smaller, fine-tuned models that were trained exclusively with one convention.
   *
   * Set this flag to `false` if your model is specifically trained with camelCase tool descriptions
   * to skip the conversion. Otherwise, the default of `true` (using snake_case) is recommended.
   *
   * Note: This flag is read only when a new [Conversation] is created. Changing this value will not
   * affect any existing [Conversation] instances.
